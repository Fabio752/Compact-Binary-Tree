The idea is very similar to the Binary Tree project.
In this algorithm, however, the function is firstly displayed in a vector and then the algorithm builds the tree going through the vector.
The tree which is built is not equal to the previously explained binary tree, but it is fully compacted.
Let's see the same functions used as examples in the binary tree what will generate now:

For X1 & X2:


                                          X1
                                  0                 X2
                                               0          1
                      
                  
And for X1 or X2:


                                          X1
                               X2                   1
                          0          1
